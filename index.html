      A mango is an edible
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drupe">stone fruit</a> produced by
      the tropical tree
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangifera_indica"
        >Mangifera indica.</a
      >
      It is believed to have originated in the region between northwestern
      Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India. M. indica has been cultivated
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South</a> and
      Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango
      cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius
      of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are long-lived, as some specimens still
      fruit after 300 years.[10]
    </p>
    <p>
      In deep soil, the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taproot">taproot</a> descends to a
      depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor
      roots penetrating deeply into the soil.The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaf">leaves</a> are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evergreen">evergreen,</a>
      alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm
      (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink,
      rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature.
      The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flower">flowers</a> are
      produced in terminal
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panicle">panicles</a> 10–40 cm
      (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10
      millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.Over 500
      varieties of mangoes are known, many of which ripen in summer, while some
      give a double crop.The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to
      ripen.
